Smart irrigation is a technology-based system that uses sensors and data to optimize watering, delivering the right amount of water at the right time to plants. It integrates technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), soil and weather sensors, and automation to monitor conditions and automatically adjust irrigation schedules, preventing overwatering while ensuring plants get the water they need, which saves water, energy, and promotes healthier growth.
